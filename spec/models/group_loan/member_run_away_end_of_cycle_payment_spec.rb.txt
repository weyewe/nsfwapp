# Case 1: member run away mid-cycle 

=begin
1. Handle the Run Away case
     Branch Submit the form (written + double signed by Loan Officer + Branch Manager ), 
      so that it will be deactivated by the central command.  
      => the runaway member will be blocked from all group loan product 

     For each GroupLoanProduct that are currently active, the branch
     has to submit the payment decision: whether default resolved weekly, or and the end-of-cycle

     1. Weekly
        There is extra payment to be made (total = all active members + run away member)
        In the payment details: list all active member's payment + entry for the run away member. 
        That's it.  => compose reports 


     2. End of cycle
          In the weekly payment, ignore the extra payment caused by the run away member
          At the end of the cycle, deduct all active's compulsory savings by the amount debted.  
          
          If there is excess,
